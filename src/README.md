AI-Driven Care-Path Orchestrator Simulation

This repository contains the source code, simulation engine, and validation scripts for the research paper: "AI-Driven Care-Path Orchestrator: Reducing Ambulatory Latency via Multi-Agent Event Sourcing."

📂 Project Structure

src/simulation_engine.py: A SimPy Discrete Event Simulation (DES) modeling 1,000 patient episodes across Legacy (manual) vs. Orchestrator (AI-driven) workflows.

src/data_visualizer.py: Generates the histograms and heatmaps used in the paper (Figures 1 & 2) using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

src/llm_poc.py: A Proof-of-Concept script demonstrating the Radiology-to-JSON extraction logic (Module B of the proposed architecture).

simulation_results.csv: The raw dataset generated by the simulation.

🚀 How to Run

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Simulation
This will execute the Monte Carlo simulation for 1,000 patients and generate the CSV data.

python src/simulation_engine.py


Generate Plots
This will read the CSV and create the high-resolution images found in the Results section.

python src/data_visualizer.py


Test LLM Extraction
Run the NLP demonstration to see how radiology text is parsed into structured referral data.

python src/llm_poc.py


📊 Methodology

The simulation compares two operational modes:

Legacy Workflow: Modeled using LogNormal distributions to simulate human behavior (e.g., email delays, manual data entry, business hours).

Orchestrator Workflow: Modeled using Normal distributions with millisecond-scale means to simulate API latency and AI inference speed.
